# Project Specific Context

## Purpose
Comprehensive DJ music production and library management system for YDJ, encompassing playlist optimization (harmonic mixing), Apple Music library metadata management, and YouTube media processing.

## Current Priority
**Phase 2: Library Management Enhancement** (genre/year tagging workflow complete, cleanup improvements next)

## Completed Phases
- ✅ **Phase 1:** Foundation & Organization — modular structure, genres.json, Git/GitHub
- ✅ **Phase 4:** AppleScript integration — direct year/genre updates to Apple Music working

## Recent Session (2026-02-16)
- ✅ Added locked fields: consistent metadata (year/genre) is preserved as-is, only inconsistent fields are resolved
- ✅ Added targeted web search (Source C) for year-only inconsistency groups to find correct original release year
- ✅ Resolver displays locked fields with "(locked)" indicator and skips updating them
- **Next**: Continue resolving inconsistency groups, then BPM/key auditing

## Previous Session (2026-02-15)
- ✅ Fixed AppleScript track update reliability with artist+name search fallback
- ✅ Enhanced `update_track_metadata()` to search by artist+name instead of database ID
- ✅ Eliminated dependency on fresh XML exports for track updates
- ✅ Updated `run-resolver.sh` and `run-tagger.sh` to auto-activate venv
- ✅ Tested and validated `/resolve-inconsistencies` workflow (229 groups ready to resolve)

## Previous Session (2026-02-14)
- ✅ Built interactive inconsistency resolver (detect → research → fix/ignore per group)
- ✅ Added `add_tracks_to_playlist()` AppleScript capability to `common/apple_music.py`
- ✅ Created `/resolve-inconsistencies` slash command (229 groups detected in 8,549 DJ tracks)
- ✅ Source A computed from group majority (no extra library search needed)
- ✅ "Ignore year or genre inconsistencies" playlist auto-created and used for filtering

## Constraints and Conventions

### Safety Constraints
- **AppleScript writes are live**: Year and genre updates go directly to Apple Music via AppleScript
- **Always backup before bulk operations**: Apple Music library contains 10,000+ tracks
- **Interactive confirmation**: Tagger requires manual keypress (1/2/S) per track — no unattended bulk writes

### Genre Taxonomy Rules
- Use compound genres exactly as they appear in library (e.g., "EDM, House, Techno")
- 31 canonical genres cover tracks with 20+ songs
- Smaller genres (<20 songs) will be reclassified later
- Compound genres solve "is it House or Techno?" ambiguity problem

### Code Conventions
- Python 3.x for all automation scripts
- Bash/shell scripts for media processing (ffmpeg-based)
- Each subfolder has its own `CLAUDE.md` for focused AI agent context
- Shared utilities go in `common/` folder

### File Naming
- Use kebab-case for folders: `library-management`, `ydj-music-studio`
- Python modules: snake_case (e.g., `apple_music.py`, `metadata_utils.py`)
- Shell scripts: snake_case with `.sh` extension

## Run Commands / Environment

### Python Environment Setup
```bash
cd ~/Projects/ydj-music-studio
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Required Python Packages (requirements.txt)
- pandas
- numpy
- mutagen (audio file metadata)
- fuzzywuzzy (fuzzy string matching)
- python-Levenshtein (fuzzywuzzy speedup)

### Apple Music Integration
**Reading:** Smart playlists read directly via AppleScript (e.g., "Genre or Year Blank")
**Writing:** Year and genre updated via AppleScript (`tag_tracks.py`)
  - Primary: Artist+name search (reliable, no XML dependency)
  - Fallback: Database ID (legacy compatibility)
**XML Export:** Used for bulk metadata reading (`~/YDJ Library.xml`)

### Media Processing (ffmpeg)
```bash
# Install ffmpeg via Homebrew (if not already installed)
brew install ffmpeg

# Process MKV files in downloads folder
cd ~/Projects/ydj-music-studio/downloads
./process_mkv.sh           # Classify and extract audio from static videos
./convert_mkv_to_mp4.sh    # Lossless remux compatible files
./reencode_all_mkv.sh      # Transcode incompatible codecs
./convert_opus_to_aac.sh   # Convert Opus audio to AAC
```

### Mixer Usage (Current)
```bash
cd ~/Projects/ydj-music-studio/mixer
python3 mixer.py
# Note: Currently uses hardcoded track list; will be enhanced in Phase 3
```

## Integrations / Assets

### Apple Music Library
- **Location**: `~/YDJ Library.xml` (manual XML export)
- **Format**: Apple PropertyList (plist) XML
- **Size**: ~10,000 tracks
- **Update Frequency**: Manual export as needed

### Genre Taxonomy
- **Location**: `common/genres.json`
- **Source**: Extracted from Apple Music library
- **Count**: 31 compound genres (20+ songs threshold)
- **Format**: Simple JSON array of strings

### Media Files
- **YouTube Downloads**: User's download folder (outside repo)
- **Processed Media**: Moved to `processed/` subfolder after conversion
- **Working Directory**: Downloads happen outside repo; scripts process in-place

### External APIs
- ✅ MusicBrainz: Release dates, genres (integrated in `sources/musicbrainz.py`, 1 req/sec rate limit)
- Discogs: DJ-focused metadata (future)
- Spotify: Audio features, modern genres (future)
- Last.fm: Genre tags, similar artists (future)

## Slash Commands
- `/fill-missing-genres-years` — End-to-end workflow: research → LLM/web fill → interactive tagging
- `/resolve-inconsistencies` — Detect and resolve year/genre conflicts across track variants (229 groups)
- `/rebaseline-project` — Update docs and commit to GitHub
- `/update-project-todos` — Sync Todoist

## Notes
- Smart playlist "Genre or Year Blank" drives the missing-metadata tagging workflow
- "Ignore year or genre inconsistencies" playlist filters out already-resolved groups
- Interactive scripts (`tag_tracks.py`, `resolve_tagger.py`) require a real TTY — run via `run-tagger.sh` / `run-resolver.sh`
- XML export (`~/YDJ Library.xml`) used for bulk detection; AppleScript used for reads/writes
