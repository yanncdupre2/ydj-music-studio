# AI Agent Context (Static Stub)

This file is intentionally static. Do not edit it.

Read these files before doing any work:
1. `PLANNING.md`
2. `PROJECT-LOCAL-CONTEXT.md`
3. `/Users/fydupre/global-ai-agents-instructions/GLOBAL-CONTEXT.md`

When initializing or updating project context (e.g., via a /init command), update **only** `PROJECT-LOCAL-CONTEXT.md`.
